//! ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places"), is a simple substitution cipher that replaces a letter
//!with the letter 13 places after it in the alphabet.
//!ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome.
//!
//! Because there are 26 letters (2√ó13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse;
//!that is, `ROT13(ROT13(message)) = message`.
//!
//! ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions,
//!and offensive materials from the casual glance.
use common::alphabet;

/// Encrypt or decrypt a message using the ROT13 substitute cipher.
///
/// # Examples
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```
/// use cryptrs::rot13;
///
/// let m = "This is really insecure";
/// assert_eq!(m, rot13::apply(&rot13::apply(m)));
/// ```
